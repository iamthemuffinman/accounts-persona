meteor-accounts-persona
=======================

Add Mozilla Persona to your Meteor app!

The code for this came from here: https://github.com/vladikoff/meteor-accounts-persona

I forked this so that I could remove oauth as a dependency. With Persona, there really isn't a point to add oauth into the mix.
